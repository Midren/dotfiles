# Dotfiles

Everybody needs dotfiles, so here are my.

## Usage

If you ever want to use this one, you can easily do it:
```
git clone https://github.com/RomanMilishchuk/dotfiles
cd dotfiles
./install.sh
```

This is done by usage of [Dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot/tree/7ffaa65482a59fa485e7a8f19fe07a33694fc157).

Currently, is supported only whole installation, but `install.conf.yaml` for now has divided into logical connected parts
in such way, that they don't depend on each other.
